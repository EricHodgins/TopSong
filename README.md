# TopSong
An iOS app that allows you share your favourite 3 songs with your friends.  

The main purpose is so people can quickly checkout songs from their friends they might like and learn their musical tastes.
If the song is not already on their device they can add it to their HitList and the app will query YouTube videos for the
user to checkout.

The Top Picks in the ProfileViewController are chosen from the devices music app library.  The TopSongsViewController downloads all the friends top songs.  This is where a song can be chosen to be put in the HitList.  Once in the HitList you can choose songs and videos from YouTube will be queried.

A user must create a username once they've created an accout to be found.  This will be unique for all users.  They can also choose a profile name that their friends will see them as.
